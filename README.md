# STUDENT 
# TASK 1: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning 
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score 
based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves 
just two variables.

# IRIS
# TASK 6: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning Using Decision Tree
In this Classification task we will predict the Species of Iris that is Setosa, Versicolour, 
and Virginica based upon their length and width of sepals and petals. 
This is a Classification Regressor task as it involves just Five variables.
